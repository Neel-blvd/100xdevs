This ensures that anyone else using your project will also install commander when they run npm install.

Why This Happens
When you require a module that isnâ€™t installed, Node.js throws a MODULE_NOT_FOUND error.
Installing the missing module resolves this by making the module available to your project.
Now, your script should work as expected, and you can use your CLI tool to count lines in a file!
